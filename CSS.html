<h2>CSS란 무엇일까요?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss" target="_blank" title="CSS specification">CSS</a></strong> is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
  <br>It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.
  <br>CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
  <br>The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments.
  <br>This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>
